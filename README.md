# BaseballSeasonX
Statistical Baseball Pitch Tracking Software


The purpose of Baseball Season X is to develop a hobbyist's dream of tracking a baseball game/season pitch-by-pitch. Each pitch will be stored in a database and visualised in various screens.

The Project will be developed in SQL Server as the backend and the front-end will be a C# WinForms application.
